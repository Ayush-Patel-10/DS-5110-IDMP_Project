My Doc is a comprehensive hospital management system that provides a range of benefits for hospitals, clinics, doctors, and patients alike. With its streamlined operations, enhanced administration, and strict cost control, the system offers superior patient care and improved profitability.
One of the key features of the system is its user registration and management capabilities. Patients, doctors, and administrators can create accounts and manage their information, appointments, and schedules through the application. The system also allows users to book appointments with doctors seamlessly, eliminating the need for navigating through complex hospital directories or making multiple calls.

The application has advanced features for doctors to view their list of appointments and analyze the history of a particular patient to provide better diagnosis. After an appointment, the doctor can prescribe medicines, suggest lab tests, and generate the final bill for the patient. The system also handles prescriptions and lab reports, making it easier for doctors to keep track of their patients' medical history.
My Doc is built on SQL with Python frameworks, making it powerful, flexible, and easy to use. The application has advanced data visualization capabilities, allowing administrators to view workforce and scheduling data graphically. The system also performs integrity checks on the data being fed into the database to avoid any discrepancies or malicious data being entered.
